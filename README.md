# Twitter Transportation Incident Map

React application that takes data from a backend API that uses Twitter's streaming API to find Tweets in real time from verified Twitter accounts (presumably local government and news agencies) with key words indicating that the Tweets refer to a transportation-related incident (auto accident, hazmat spill, etc), and plots the Tweets on a map. Map markers can be filtered by date range, category, and/or search term.
